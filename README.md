Don't have dreams, have goals. Here are my SWE goals:
- become a chronic contributor to good open-source projects
- design, develop and maintain data-intensive applications, with emphasis on scalability, reliability, and maintainability
- collaborate with SWE's who love, respect, and hone the craft
